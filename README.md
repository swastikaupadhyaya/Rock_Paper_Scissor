# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This is a simple command-line game of Rock, Paper, Scissors created using Python. The player competes against the computer, which randomly selects an option. The game evaluates the choices and declares a winner based on the standard rules.

- How to Play
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. You’ll be prompted to choose an option:
    Type 0 for Rock
    Type 1 for Paper
    Type 2 for Scissors
3. The computer also makes a choice.
4. The game then displays both choices and declares the result as either a win, loss, or draw.
     
- Code Overview
